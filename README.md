# Supported Themes

In the long term I plan to support all the default themes, and my own themes. I would also consider adding support for other peoples themes as well (although you can easily add support to your own themes if you wish).

* [Twenty Ten](https://wordpress.org/themes/twentyten)
* [Twenty Thirteen](https://wordpress.org/themes/twentythirteen)
* [Twenty Fifteen](https://wordpress.org/themes/twentyfifteen)
* [Puzzle](https://creativemarket.com/BinaryMoon/108641-Puzzle-Responsive-WordPress-Theme?u=BinaryMoon)

Why do I add support for my themes? My themes are available on wordpress.com and <a href="https://creativemarket.com/BinaryMoon?u=BinaryMoon">Creative Market</a>. As such I don't want to have two copies of each theme since it makes maintenance a pain - so I am adding support directly into the plugin.

# Adding theme support

Styleguide allows any theme to add support through the 'add_theme_support' command. For examples check out the [included theme-styles](https://github.com/BinaryMoon/styleguide/tree/master/theme-styles).
